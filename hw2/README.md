## Homework 2 : Little-GO Agent
This code is a little tricky to understand as the course producers set up random agents we could play against on vocareum and monitor the results there. All we were in charge of doing was being able to parse an input that contains our agent's color, and the current state of the 5x5 gameboard.

Our output is to either return a location to place a tile or to PASS. You can check if this works manually by typing:
```console
python my_player3.py
```
